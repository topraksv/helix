 * directory, a changed extension or a different working directory quietly
 * turns an architectural guard into a green test that checks nothing, and the
 * suite reports it as coverage. Four copies of the walk had drifted apart
 * before this, and none of them said how many files they expected.
 *
 * `atLeast` has no default because the floor is part of the assertion.
