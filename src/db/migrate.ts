/**
 * Async migration runner over the drizzle-kit journal. Uses the same table
 * and timestamp bookkeeping as drizzle's own migrator (`__drizzle_migrations`,
 * compared by the journal's `when`) so installs created by the previous sync
 * migrator continue seamlessly. The `hash` column exists only for schema
 * compatibility with drizzle's migrator and is intentionally left empty —
 * applied-migration content is never re-verified against it.
